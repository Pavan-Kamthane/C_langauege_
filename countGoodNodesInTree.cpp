// Leetcode 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
// Medium

/*Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path

Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

// Algorithm used here:

// We will simply traverse the given tree in a preOrder fashion and keep a track of the maximum value of a node from the root to that node in a variable max everytime we see that the current root's value is greater than the maximum we increment our answer(the number of good nodes) and update the maximum value of the max. We will use a helper function for this
